### What I learned

I learnt the use of SetInterval which is called by using (SetInterval,1000) which means To do the same action in 1000ms

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
  <div class="element days-c">
    <p class="big-text" id="days">0</p>
  <span>days</span>
```
```js
    const total_seconds = (newYearsDate - currentDate) / 1000;

```
